        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 bowls steamed leftover rice</li>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped kimchi (should be aged, well-fermented and sour)</li>
                <li>¼ cup kimchi juice (spicy red juice from a jar of kimchi)</li>
                <li>2-3 tablespoons gochujang</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 green onion (chopped)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon roasted sesame seeds</li>
                <li>1 sheet of gim, roasted and shredded into seaweed strips</li>
                <li>Pork belly</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan on medium-high heat without oil, add chopped pork belly. Spread it apart and cook your pork belly so that the edges are browned and the fat renders off, about 5-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Next toss in onion, garlic, and kimchi. Stir-fry until the juices release from the kimchi into the pan, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cooked rice, regular soy sauce, kimchi juice, gochujang, and sesame oil. Toss everything together until rice granules are red in color. </li>
            <li>Lastly garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Remove off heat and serve with Korean seaweed flakes and a fried egg on top. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
